# OpenFrameworks CMake Template for Linux

Developed under Arch Linux, using the AUR version of OF v0.11.0 (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openframeworks)

This is a straightforward port of the C and linker flags from OF's project generator to CMake. It's recommended to install the AUR version first to take care of dependencies. This assumes that projects generated via OF's projectGenerator build fine. No care was taken to support OF addons.
